README for AI-based Music NFT Platform
Introduction
This platform leverages AI-generated music and NFT technology to create a decentralized ecosystem for creators and listeners. By integrating Ethereum smart contracts, users can mint music as NFTs, engage with a decentralized marketplace, and earn rewards through participation.

Features
Minting NFTs: Creators generate music using AI and mint it as NFTs via Ethereum smart contracts.
Revenue Sharing: NFTs earn revenue which is automatically distributed among owners based on ownership share.
Earn Mechanism: Both creators and listeners can earn rewards through creation, voting, or engagement activities.
Decentralized Governance: The platform is governed through a DAO where NFT holders vote on future developments.
Requirements
Solidity ^0.8.25
OpenZeppelin Contracts (ERC721, ECDSA)
Ethereum-compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask)
