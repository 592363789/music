AI Music NFT Platform - README
## Overview
This project aims to provide a platform for AI-generated music NFTs, allowing creators to tokenize their music and engage with collectors through unique digital assets. It is built using Solidity smart contracts and integrates with a Web3 wallet for blockchain interactions.
## Features
- AI-powered music creation and tokenization.
- NFT minting and trading platform.
- Ownership and provenance tracking.
- Integration with Ethereum blockchain.
## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js
- Hardhat
- MetaMask for Web3 wallet integration
- An Ethereum testnet account with some ETH
## Installation

cd ai-music-nft-platform
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
4. Compile the smart contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```
5. Run a local Ethereum node:
```bash
npx hardhat node
```
6. Deploy the contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
## Usage
1. Connect your MetaMask wallet to the deployed platform.
2. Mint new AI-generated music NFTs by interacting with the smart contracts.
3. List or trade NFTs on the platform's marketplace.
4. Use the blockchain explorer to track NFT ownership and provenance.
