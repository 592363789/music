- **Music NFTs**: Mint AI-generated music into NFTs.
- **Marketplace**: Trade NFTs directly on the platform.
- **Revenue Sharing**: Automatic distribution to NFT creators.
- **Governance**: Token holders can vote on platform decisions.

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js** and **npm** installed.
- **Hardhat** for Ethereum development.

Smart Contract Overview
NFTMint.sol
This contract allows users to mint unique music NFTs based on AI-generated content. Users submit a hash of their music data to create a non-fungible token (NFT) representing their ownership of the content.

RevenueDistribution.sol
Automates the process of distributing revenue from NFT sales to the appropriate stakeholders (e.g., creators, collaborators).

Governance.sol
Implements a decentralized governance system allowing token holders to propose and vote on platform changes.

Usage
After deploying, you can interact with the platform via the web interface or directly through the contracts using tools like ethers.js or web3.js.

Minting a new NFT:

Interact with the NFTMint contract and call the mint function with the AI-generated music's metadata and artist signature.
Marketplace:

Use the Marketplace.sol contract to list and sell NFTs.
Governance:

Propose changes to the platform or participate in voting using the Governance contract.
